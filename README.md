# small_processor
## INTRODUCTION

This reprository is about small processor which is able to perform certain few arithmatic operations like addition,multiplication and substraction.The processor design based is based on the verilog HDL. The basic fundamentals of CISC based processor architecture is used to esign microinstructions and control signals. The tested clock rate for the design ewas 2Mhz.
